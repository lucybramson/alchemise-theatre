            <p class="project-page-text">During this year long project, participants will be invited to create their own superhero alter-ego, and work with our designer to co-create a costume. Using drama techniques, we will then collectively create a story that will be handed over to one of our award winning illustrators and turned into a comic book. The project will culminate in a final event to launch the comic book and showcase the superhero costumes.<br><br>Sessions will be trauma informed, covid-risk assessed, and tailored specifically to the needs of young people with Long Covid.  We will have 1-2-1 online sessions before the project with young people and your parent/carers to establish where you’re at and what you need from us access wise. Those who are bedbound or housebound will be able to join our online sessions from bed. We will provide beanbags and yoga mats for in-person sessions so you can choose to sit or lie-down. All sessions will be no more than an hour long and will include active rest breaks, nervous system support, breathwork, gentle movement and bite-sized creative exercises.<br><br>Online sessions: TBC<br><br>In-person sessions: TBC<br><br>**N.B. We are aware that the ‘superhero’ trope can often be used in a patronising and ableist way to pose achievements from the disabled community as ‘inspirational’ and to suggest we can simply ‘overcome’ our disability without the need for external support and adaptations. Our aim is to invert the usual superhero tropes, and to highlight the strength in the stillness, the quiet, the pause; the ability to accept and to ask for help; the ability to listen to our bodies and say no to the demands made by an ableist society; the ability to advocate for ourselves and the disabled community. We invite the young people to celebrate their new identity as chronically ill, and to find ways to cope with the struggles and find the peace. After all, rest is radical.</p>
